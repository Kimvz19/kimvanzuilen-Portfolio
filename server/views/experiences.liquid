        Framer Framed requested us to rethink and build the ðŸ’» Archive website, which shows the connections of all the exhibitions, work and data collected over the years.
        <br>
        This website is free for the public and accessible for everyone, which jumps to the point of the project. 
        <br>
        <br>
        The Archive website needed a make-over to be accessible for everyone (comply with the rules of WCAG guidelines) but also specifically 
        for one target group with a disability, while redesigning how their data was.

            <p class="badge-darkpink">Goal 1</p>
            <p>
              Improving the User Experience in the project by applying techniques such as view transitions, better transitions and visually appealing interfaces & consistency.
            </p>

            <p class="badge-white">Elaboration</p>
            <p>
              Agreement with Cyd to use view transitions in the project. After adding new techniques, ask for feedback on visual impact and usability.

            <p class="badge-white">Elaboration</p>
            <p>
              Developing a more active attitude by actively participating in every lesson or meeting, thinking along with questions, understanding all the information. If not, ask a question. Prepare questions for the lesson, maybe check-ins with the teachers, more feedback on code or on the way of working.

              Out of the box thinking & working. Creative skills improvement with colors, experimenting with techniques, using different coding elements, stepping out of the comfort zone!

            <p>
              Weekly experimenting, trying new color combinations, layouts. Collecting inspiration and trying it out, making mistakes is part of the process.

      <h2> 
        ðŸ‘€ Reflection</h2>
      <p>
       Reflecting on the project, I grew a lot through the whole process, from the concept to the final product. The teamwork was a big positive thing in this project.
       Without our teamwork our project would not be what it is now. I really enjoyed working with my team. The communication was good, we were all responsible and respectfull, we gave each other feedback and we helped each other. 
       <br>
       <br>
       I think my part of the project was my succes of all the information that I absorbed this minor. From the basic form with HTML to CSS styling working with gradients and box-shadows to 
       making the website accessible with WCAG guidelines, clamp, color contrast checking extc.
       <br>
       <br>
       Described in my product Biograph, I'm proud that I successsfully completed my goals for this project. The last weeks were sometimes hard for me,
       because I had to work hard this whole minor but I'm really proud on my process and I would do it all over again!

        For the Hackathon, together with Tymo and David, we created a game "Guess who?", specially made for women in the tech! For people
        to get to know the women in a fun and interactive way!
        <br>
        The game is made with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. We created the game in 4 days time. We had 2 days to come up with a concept and 2 today to make it in code.
        Together with my team we brainstormed about the concept, worked it out and finally presented it.

      <p>
       The solution to praise the women in tech is a game "Guess who?". The styling is inspired by women in tech global conference. 
       With their house style, we made the game and we of course played the game ourselves. We, as a group, got rewarded with tickets to the 
       CSS day Conference in Amsterdam, which we were very excited about!

        David made a 3D board with only CSS. I would love to be able to do that myself as well. I also want to 
        improve my skills with JavaScript. This is a language I am the least good in, but I'm willing to learn so 
        this will be my next project!

      <p>
        My part in this project is making up de concept, designing the game and making wireframes and of course building the home page.
        Tymo connected the game to the database and David made the 3D board. The teamwork went really well but we didn't have too much time to 
        work out the game any further because we only had 4 days to complete the project.

      <p>
        Reflecting on the Hackathon, I can say that it was a great experience. I never joined a Hackathon in my life so it was a 
        good but hectic experience. I thought the time pressure was a bit much, but that made it also more exciting.
        It was really fun to work together in such a short time, but we're really happy with the endresult ofcourse.
