        For the Hackathon, I teamed up with Tymo and David to create a game called "Guess Who - Women in Tech Edition". The goal was to introduce inspiring women in tech in a fun and interactive way.
        <br>
        <br>
        We built the game using HTML, CSS and JavaScript ‚Äî all within just 4 days. We spent the first 2 days developing the concept and the next 2 coding and polishing the game. As a team, we brainstormed, refined our ideas, and proudly presented the final result.

      <h2 class="gradient-greypink"> ‚ú® Solution</h2>
      <p>
        The solution to celebrate women in tech was a ‚ÄúGuess Who?‚Äù - game. The design was inspired by the branding of the Women in Tech global conference. Using their house style, we built the game and even played it ourselves.
        <br>
        <br>
        As a team, we were thrilled to win tickets to the CSS Day Conference in Amsterdam ‚Äî such a rewarding and exciting outcome!

      <h2> New insights</h2>
      <p>
        David built a 3D game board using only CSS ‚Äî something I'd love to learn to do as well! I also want to improve my JavaScript skills, as it's the language I'm currently least confident in. This will definitely be the focus of my next personal project.

      <h2>My part in this project</h2>
      <p>
        My responsibilities included coming up with the concept, designing the game, creating wireframes, and building the homepage. Tymo connected the game to the database, while David worked on the 3D board.
        <br>
        <br>
        Our teamwork went really well, but with only four days to complete everything, we didn't have time to expand the game further.

        üëÄ Reflection</h2>
      <p>
        Looking back on the Hackathon, I can truly say it was a great experience. I had never joined one before, so it was both exciting and a little overwhelming.
        <br>
        <br>
        The time pressure was intense, but it also made the process more dynamic. It felt amazing to collaborate and deliver something functional in such a short amount of time ‚Äî and we're proud of the final result!
