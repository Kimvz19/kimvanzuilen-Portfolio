          For my Information Design minor, I created a short film using data visualizations to raise awareness about the impact of light pollution on the environment in Amsterdam.
          <br>
          </br>
          Together with my group, I produced the film at Artis â€” inside the dome! ðŸª©

      <h3>âœ¨ What Have I Learned</h3>
      <p>
        During this project, I learned how to develop a concept based on research, work with a 360Â° camera, and create data visualizations through editing and storytelling. The dome uses 360Â° projections, which means the film surrounds the viewer completely.

        This was a truly unique experience. I grew up visiting the zoo, so being chosen to create a film for Artis felt like a full-circle moment. I really enjoyed working on something innovative, and it became a once-in-a-lifetime experience.
