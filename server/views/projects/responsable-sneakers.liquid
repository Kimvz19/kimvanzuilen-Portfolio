      <h3>✨ What Have I Learned</h3>
      <p>
        Producing clothing and shoes is a complex process that involves many harmful materials and chemicals. Creating an environmentally friendly sneaker turned out to be quite challenging and required extensive research. I learned a lot about sustainable materials and now have a much better understanding of what it takes to develop a product from scratch.

      <p>I was surprised by how difficult it is to create your own product and brand. It takes a lot of time, effort, and perseverance. But I'm really proud of what we've achieved — and of all the research and knowledge we've gained along the way!
